# FASTPAY_BASE

## Deploy layout (staging and production)

Staging and production use fixed base paths and a shared deploy process. For where to put code, which URLs serve what after deploy, GitHub sync, and the full deploy steps, see:

- **[docs/VPS_DEPLOY_STRUCTURE.md](docs/VPS_DEPLOY_STRUCTURE.md)** — Target layout (`/var/www/fastpay` for production, `/desktop/fastpay` for staging), URLs after deploy, GitHub sync script, and complete deploy process.
