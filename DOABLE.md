# DOABLE – FASTPAY_BASE Project Tasks

This document is the **central place for small, concrete tasks** for the `FASTPAY_BASE` project.

When you (or the assistant) say **“add in DOABLE”**, it means:

- **Scope**: Add a new item to this `DOABLE.md` file in the `FASTPAY_BASE` root directory.
- **Size**: Each item should be small and realistically doable (not a huge project).
- **Format**: Use short bullet points with clear, action-style wording.

## Rules for DOABLE items

- Add items **only for this repository** (`FASTPAY_BASE`).
- Prefer **one bullet per action**.
- Keep wording **brief and specific**, e.g.:
  - `- Implement GmailSection loading spinner state`
  - `- Refactor auth.ts token refresh logic`

## DOABLE Items

(New items go here as bullets.)
