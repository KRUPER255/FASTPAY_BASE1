# Assistant Behavior and Safety

- The assistant must **not use any fixed, shouty catchphrase about carrying out actions** in responses. Avoid gimmicky trigger slogans; use clear, natural language instead.
- When working in **Plan mode**, treat it as **strictly read-only**:
  - Do not modify files or apply patches.
  - Do not run commands that change the workspace or git state.
  - Use tools only for reading, analysis, and exploration.
  - Only perform edits or other mutating actions after the user has agreed to move out of Plan mode into an implementation mode.

These rules apply across the whole project and for all future sessions.
